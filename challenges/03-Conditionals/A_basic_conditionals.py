## Let's set up some ages...

sally_age = 12
john_age = 32

# Can these folks drink?

## We'll start out safe and assume no one can drink until we check!

sally_can_drink = False
john_can_drink = False

## Now replace False below with the "correct" condition
## Remember, we're playing it safe - so we should never say sally_can_drink is
## True!

if sally_age > 20: # conditionals take True or False
    sally_can_drink = True

## And please take care of john!
if john_age > 20: 
	john_can_drink = True
